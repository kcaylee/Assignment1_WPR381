# Spotify Lookup Application

This project is a Node.js application that retrieves song information from Spotify based on user input provided through the terminal. The app leverages Spotify's API, using NPM modules to handle API calls and JSON parsing, and reads commands from a file to execute specific actions. The primary function of this application is to look up song information on Spotify and present details such as the artist(s), song title, preview link, and album.
